When we work, we access many files, and in general they are in different directories. Thus we have to type related( or absolute ) path or move to the directory which includes the file which we want to access. 

This script help you to omit to type such a tiresome work. This script keeps file name and its absolute directory information which you accessed, and you can briefly access the file which you read or wrote previously.
